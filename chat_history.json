The app will allow you to store data for different tracks, days, and times, with specific readings for each lane (Left and Right). You'll also need the ability to upload pictures for each lane and compare data across different conditions and days.\n\nHere's a plan to get started:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n-   **Track Management:** A screen to add and manage different race tracks.\n-   **Data Entry:** A screen to input readings for each track, day, and time, including fields for Left Lane and Right Lane data (Track Temp, UV Index, Keg SL, Keg Out, Grippo SL, Grippo Out, Shine, and Notes), as well as image upload functionality for each lane.\n-   **Data Browsing/Comparison:** A screen to browse and compare data across different tracks, days, and times.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#f0f0f0` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#666666` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#007bff` (Blue)\n    *   Secondary: `#6c757d` (Gray)\n    *   Accent: `#28a745` (Green)\n    *   Card: `#ffffff` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#ffc107` (Yellow)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like \"System\" for a native look and feel.\n\nNow, let's create a plan for the coding agent to implement these features.\n\n**Plan for the Coding Agent:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** Ensure the project is set up with React Native and Expo 54.\n2.  **Navigation:** Implement basic tab navigation (using `app/(tabs)/`) for the main screens: \"Tracks,\" \"Record Data,\" and \"Browse Data.\"\n3.  **\"Tracks\" Screen:** Create a basic UI for the \"Tracks\" screen. This screen should allow the user to add new tracks.\n4.  **\"Record Data\" Screen:** Create the UI for the data entry screen, including input fields for all the specified parameters (Left Lane and Right Lane data: Track Temp, UV Index, Keg SL, Keg Out, Grippo SL, Grippo Out, Shine, and Notes) and image upload buttons for each lane.\n5.  **\"Browse Data\" Screen:** Create a basic UI for the \"Browse Data\" screen. This screen will allow the user to select a track, day and time to view the data.\n6.  **Remove Demo Content:** Remove the `modalDemos` array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` as it's not relevant to the app's functionality.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan and modifies the `app/(tabs)` folder to implement the changes and make the changes visible for the user, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-12-21T22:42:50.991739"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive race track data recording app!
